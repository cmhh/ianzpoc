"Illness attributable to air quality","<p>This indicator shows the health impacts on New Zealanders from exposure to air pollutants. The indicator focuses on hospital admissions that are the result of exposure to fine particles (i.e. particles less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter, PM<sub>2.5</sub>) from human-generated sources, for example, burning wood for home heating.</p><p><strong>This measure still needs to be developed.</strong></p><p>Currently we are using a proxy measure that models the health impacts of PM<sub>10</sub>. PM<sub>10</sub> is a pollutant of concern because it can cause respiratory problems, and reduce lung development and functioning.</p>","14","New Zealanders (per 100,000) were estimated to have been admitted to hospital because of exposure to PM<sub>10</sub> in 2016."
